#summary IOReplay - converting to binary format

= Binary format =
Storing and also processing text output from strace command is inefficient. For that reason, one can convert it to the binary form that has following advantages:
  * it is approximately twice smaller
  * it is much faster to process when loading 
  * it is also architecture (32/64bits) independent

= How =
To convert file _strace.out_ to the binary file called _strace.bin, run:
{{{
ioreplay -c -f strace.out -o strace.bin
}}}

Don't forget to use *-F binary* option for [ioreplay] when working with binary files.
