#summary Screenshots of IOProfiler
This page describes IOProfiler on a real life example - IO profiling of starting Thunderbird v17.0.4. Ever wondered what taking so long to open  Thunderbird? Maybe there is just too much IO activity.

=Getting traces=
At first, we need to get traces of thunderbird during start up. We could use {{{strace}}} directly, or ioprofiler-trace which is a convenient wrapper around it:

{{{
user@hostnaname $ ioprofiler-trace thunderbird
}}}

Don't be surprised if the loading takes even longer than usual - that's because thunderbird makes quite a lot of syscalls so {{{strace}}} has quite a big overhead. But that's ok since we are now interested in access pattern not in exact timings.

Once it load, we just close the thunderbird window and check we have a trace log called "ioproftrace.log" because we did not specify another name using {{{-o}}} command line option:

{{{
user@hostnaname $ ls -l ioproftrace.log 
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 74890554 Apr  4 22:04 ioproftrace.log
}}}

It seems OK, so we can run ioprofiler over it:
{{{
user@hostnaname $ ioprofiler ioproftrace.log 
}}}

=Main application window=
The main window lists all the files that were accessed during tracing of the program. The summary page contains number of reads/writes, total number of bytes transferred and time spent in IO operations for each file listed.

After clicking the "Details button", the access pattern diagram is shown.

=Detailed information about access to a file=
The access pattern diagram shown consists of thousand of lines - each line represents one read or write request, reads in this case. The length of each line represents number of bytes transferred during the IO request. The horizontal angle of each line represents time of how low the request took. 

There is a list of all read requests on the left. The selected reads in the list can be highlighted in the plot. 

One can zoom in to see details.
