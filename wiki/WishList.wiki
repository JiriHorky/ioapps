#summary The list of things that should be improved

Here is the list of enhancements that should be added in the near future:

= IOapps suite =

  * Tracing already running applications ( -p switch for `strace`). In that case, we should investigate /proc/PID/fd links for file descriptors-to-file names mappings. In case of missing information, use some generic string for file name (i.e. `UNKNOWN_FILE1`). Right now, we report an error and ignore all IO calls for calls to file descriptors for which the `open` call is missing.
  * Handling of other system calls listed [SystemCallList#TODO_system_calls here].
  * Use [http://www.benchit.org/wiki/index.php/IOprof IOProf] as alternative list of system calls. It should have lower overhead than `strace`.

= Only IOprofiler =
  * Try to shrink memory requirements

= Only IOreplay = 
  * Better syntax support for mapping a and ignore file (see [ioreplay#Define_map_file here]).
