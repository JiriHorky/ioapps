Here is the list of enhancements that should be added in the near future:

# IOapps suite #

  * Handling of other system calls listed [here](SystemCallList#TODO_system_calls.md).
  * Use [IOProf](http://www.benchit.org/wiki/index.php/IOprof) as alternative list of system calls. It should have lower overhead than `strace`.

# Only IOprofiler #
  * Try to shrink memory requirements

# Only IOreplay #
  * Better syntax support for mapping a and ignore file (see [here](ioreplay#Define_map_file.md)).
