.SH NAME
ioreplay \- IO traces replayer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ioreplay
[\fIOPERATION\fR] \fI-f <file> \fR[\fIOPTIONS\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Replicates all IO syscalls defined in file by \fB\-f\fR option.
.PP
ioreplay is primary used to replicate recorded IO system calls.
In order to do that, several other helper functionality exists.
.PP
Usage: ioreplay \fB\-c\fR \fB\-f\fR <file> [\-F <format>] [\-o <out>] [\-v]
.IP
converts <file> in format <format> to binary form into file <out>
.PP
Usage: ioreplay \fB\-S\fR \fB\-f\fR <file> [\-v]
.IP
displays some statistics about syscalls recorded in <file> (must be in strace format)
.PP
Usage: ioreplay \fB\-C\fR \fB\-f\fR <file> [\-F <format>] [\-i <file>] [\-m <file>] [\-v]
.IP
checks whether local enviroment is ready for replaying traces recorded in <file>.
.PP
Usage: ioreplay \fB\-r\fR \fB\-f\fR <file> [\-F <format>] [\-t <mode>] [\-s <factor>] [\-b <number>] [\-i <file>] [\-m <file>] [\-v]
.IP
replicates traces recorded in <file>. Use \fB\-C\fR prior to running this.
.TP
\fB\-b\fR \fB\-\-bind\fR <number>
bind replicating process to processor number <number>
.TP
\fB\-c\fR \fB\-\-convert\fR
file to binary form, see also \fB\-o\fR
.TP
\fB\-C\fR \fB\-\-check\fR
checks that all operations recorded in the file specied by \fB\-f\fR will
succeed (ie. will result in same return code).
It takes \fB\-i\fR and \fB\-m\fR into account. See also \fB\-p\fR.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR \fB\-\-file\fR <file>
sets filename to <file>
.TP
\fB\-F\fR \fB\-\-format\fR <fmt>
specifies input format of the file.
Options: strace, bin.
Check README for details. Default is strace.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR \fB\-\-help\fR
prints this message
.TP
\fB\-i\fR \fB\-\-ignore\fR <file>
sets file containing names which we should not touch during
replaying. I.e. no syscall operation will be performed on given file.
.TP
\fB\-m\fR \fB\-\-map\fR <file>
sets containing file names mapping. When opening file,
if there is mapping for it, it will open mapped file instead.
See README for more information.
.TP
\fB\-o\fR \fB\-\-output\fR <file>
output filename when converting. Default: strace.bin.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR \fB\-\-prepare\fR
will prepare all files accesses recorded in file specified by \fB\-f\fR,
so every IO operation will return with same exit code as in original
application. See also \fB\-i\fR and/or \fB\-m\fR parameters.
Do nothing at the moment.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR \fB\-\-replicate\fR
will replicate every operation stored in file specified by \fB\-f\fR
.HP
\fB\-s\fR \fB\-\-scale\fR <factor> scales delays between calls by the factor <factor>. Used with \fB\-r\fR.
.TP
\fB\-S\fR \fB\-\-stats\fR
generate stats when processing the file. Can be combined with other
options.
.TP
\fB\-t\fR \fB\-\-timing\fR
sets timing mode for replication. Options available:
diff  \- default mode. makes sure that gaps between calls are the same as in the original run.
asap  \- makes calls one just after another.
exact \- makes sure that calls are (approximately) done in the same time as in the original run
.IP
(relative from start of the application)
.HP
\fB\-v\fR \fB\-\-verbose\fR be more verbose (do nothing at the moment)
.HP
\fB\-V\fR \fB\-\-version\fR prints version and exits.
